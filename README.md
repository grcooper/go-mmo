# Golang MMO

I just wanted to work on an MMO and see if I could get the networking up and running. This won't become anything else likely.

The base for this code was taken from: [Shoen](https://github.com/Shoen/phaser_multiplayer_demo)

# TODO:

* Fix Websocket closing errors (have a longer timeout or a heartbeat?)

# Goals

* Base network code for players to connect to the same server
* Allow players to interact in some way - probably through text
* Maybe build this into my friends slack group
